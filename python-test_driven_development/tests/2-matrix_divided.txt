Test file for matrix divided function

First import the function:
>>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided

Example matrix:
>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6]]

Basic divison test:
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
[[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]

Divide by 0 test:
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 0)
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

Div wrong type test:
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, "Hello")
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
TypeError: div must be a number

matrix is not a matrix test:
>>> matrix = {}
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

matrix uneven rows test:
>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6, 7]]
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
